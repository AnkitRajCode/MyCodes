#Desc: This code is used to convert text to morse code and morse code to text.

#Algo: first I take command through command line args then using regex I detect .text / .morse

#extension then using if-else operation i trigger function in it and previously I store all morse code in morse array with there respective charater and vice versa for text array then in function using while loop and reading each charater and stoeing in x variable then changing every charater to morse code and vise versa

#Run: bash Question1.sh < filename.txt/filename.morse >
